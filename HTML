The h1 to h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less
importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.

A nested element is a child of its parent element.

You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. 
A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.

HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. 
The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located).All img elements should have an alt attribute. 
The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.

You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element.

A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element.
