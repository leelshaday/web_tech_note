Django – Design Philosophies

Loosely Coupled − Django aims to make each element of its stack independent of the others.

Less Coding − Less code so in turn a quick development.

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) − Everything should be developed only in exactly one place instead of repeating it again and again.

Fast Development − Django's philosophy is to do all it can to facilitate hyper-fast development.

Clean Design − Django strictly maintains a clean design throughout its own code and makes it easy to follow best web-development practices.

Advantages of Django

including MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, etc. Django also supports NoSQL database through Django-nonrel fork. For now, the only NoSQL databases supported are MongoDB 
and google app engine.

Multilingual Support − Django supports multilingual websites through its built-in internationalization system. 

So you can develop your website, which would support multiple languages.

Framework Support − Django has built-in support for Ajax, RSS, Caching and various other frameworks.

Administration GUI − Django provides a nice ready-to-use user interface for administrative activities.

Development Environment − Django comes with a lightweight web server to facilitate end-to-end application development and testing.
