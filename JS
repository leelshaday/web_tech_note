JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. 
It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. 
It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages.
It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. 
JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.
Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language.
JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 


Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). 
Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.

Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another 
of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.



JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:

Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the <script> tag. 
  The <script> tag can either be placed inside the <head> or the <body> tag according to the requirement.
External JS: We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension.
  js and then link this file inside the <head> tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.
  
  
  Syntax:

<script>
    // JavaScript Code
</script>


JavaScript is considered as lightweight due to the fact that it has low CPU usage, is easy to implement and has a minimalist syntax
